                    <p class="text-md-center">Nancy first got interested in painting during an elective art course at Kent State University in Ohio.  She found it fascinating to be able to take a canvas and create in her own way whatever she was seeing in front of her.</p>
                    <p class="text-md-center">Although she has worked in acrylics, colored pencil and watercolor, she eventually found her artistic medium in oils.  The rich colors of oils are satisfying and inspiring to her.  Nancy’s main goal is to touch the viewer’s heart with each painting, attempting to present her work so that she and the viewer will feel in harmony with the finished piece.</p>
                    <p class="text-md-center">Nancy is a juried artist with Arizona Art Alliance and exhibits in many of their art shows.  She is a member of Desert Artist League and the PebbleCreek Art Club.  She has studied with Gary Jenkins, Charles Gruppe, Jim Bigger and David Flitner.  Her work has been shown at the Arizona Art Alliance Scottsdale Gallery, the Glendale Arts Council Shows, the Glendale Gallery at Westgate, the West Valley Arts Council Shows, the West Valley Art Museum Peoria Shows and City of Goodyear Art Council Exhibits.</p>

                    <p class="text-md-center">Jack was educated in a very multidisciplinary fashion with     studies in Architecture, Physics, Mathematics, and Psychology.  This was done as a recommendation by his Uncle Thomas, who advised him not to “put all of his educational eggs in one basket”.</p>
                    <p class="text-md-center">At the time of retirement Jack's love of the game of golf began to surface as the prime activity, that is, until his wife Nancy invited him, and after much protest, he accompanied her to a drawing class in their community.</p>
                    <p class="text-md-center">Jack’s final relinquishing comment was, “I hope they have a lot of good magazines to read at this class”.  He went and was invited by the instructor to just try to make a sketch and join the others.  That was the turning point.  He fell in love with drawing, then painting, historical art, then the conservation of paintings; and the list grew!</p>
                    <p class="text-md-center">Jack has studied under local artists Bill Cupit, John Balogh, Bill Martin, National artists James Biggers, Craig Birch, and International artists Dan Thompson, Rob Liberace, and Charles Grupee’. He has also studied Studio Practices and Conservation under George O’Hanlon.</p>
